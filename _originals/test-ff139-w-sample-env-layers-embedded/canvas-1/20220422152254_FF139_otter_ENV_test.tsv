205.87	217.93	<font color='rebeccapurple'>It's not really a question of genre. It's a question of marketing. The poems have not changed. Yeah, yeah. I haven't, the poems, I'm still writing the same poems. I've I haven't</font>	Transcription
217.93	235.69	<font color='rebeccapurple'>changed my sense of audience at all. But I've-- for a couple of my books, I've moved to a different publisher. And the books are being marketed differently. And I think of this in several ways. First</font>	Transcription
235.69	256.69	<font color='rebeccapurple'>of all, there's a very large market for young adult books, and there are not very many poets writing, publishing for that market. And secondly, I feel the-- giving young people real poems to read is a</font>	Transcription
256.69	272.29	<font color='rebeccapurple'>way of encouraging them to continue, to continue to be readers of poetry. So I think I'm writing for future generations of poetry readers, helping to create future poetry readers. And I think that's</font>	Transcription
272.29	281.71	<font color='rebeccapurple'>about-- I think that's about all I can say about it. I really don't believe I've changed my writing at all.</font>	Transcription

296.0	311.259	<font color='black'>Oh, I can see it. Yes. Okay. Thank you for getting it. At Furious Flower, there's a lot of discussion about regenerating tradition. And I just heard you talk about putting the tradition of poetry</font>	Transcription
311.337	326.753	<font color='black'>writing back into the-- into the schools or giving children poetry from the ground up as it were. So, the notion of poetry as a tradition-- is it something you grew up with? Did you grow up reading</font>	Transcription
326.831	334.97	<font color='black'>poetry? Did you [inaudible] a lot of your family, did you learn poems that you had to say in church, or?</font>	Transcription
335.65	349.21	<font color='rebeccapurple'><b>Marilyn Nelson</b></font>	Speaker
335.65	349.21	<font color='rebeccapurple'>I didn't have to say, or I didn't learn poems for church, but I grew up in a family which read poetry. And I grew up encouraged to read and write poetry when I was one of these</font>	Transcription
349.24	364.06	<font color='rebeccapurple'>hypersensitive children. And I cried at the drop of a hat. Beautiful sunset, I would, would reduce me to tears. And my mother always told people don't worry about Marilyn, she's our poet. She's very</font>	Transcription

365.23	366.01	<font color='peru'><b>Maryemma Graham</b></font>	Speaker
365.23	366.01	<font color='peru'>So they gave you that label. I see, okay, okay.</font>	Transcription

365.429	381.13	<font color='rebeccapurple'>Yes, yes, yes. So that's my sense of tradition. But one of the things I have been struggling to do in the last few years is to return to some of the traditional forms of poetry. I</font>	Transcription
368.28	419.76	<font color='rebeccapurple'>So you're listening to your audience?</font>	Transcription
381.218	398.498	<font color='rebeccapurple'>mean, they're European forms, but they're traditions that for several generations of African Americans have inherited. And so I've been writing in rhyme and meter again. And I think that's what-- I</font>	Transcription
398.585	415.866	<font color='rebeccapurple'>started doing it for many reasons. But one of the reasons was that I kept meeting people who would say, 'I used to like poetry, but I can't tell why poems are poems now. They seem like prose to me.</font>	Transcription
415.953	418.41	<font color='rebeccapurple'>Whatever happened to rhyme?'</font>	Transcription
419.81	422.72	<font color='rebeccapurple'>Yeah, yeah, I'm trying to, trying to.</font>	Transcription
422.24	434.626	<font color='peru'><b>Maryemma Graham</b></font>	Speaker
422.24	434.626	<font color='peru'>We've been talking today a lot about why poets write and, that is, what are the factors that figure into the process, whether it's audience or whether it's the market, so clearly you</font>	Transcription
434.694	436.94	<font color='peru'>are paying attention to audience.</font>	Transcription
437.35	451.42	<font color='rebeccapurple'><b>Marilyn Nelson</b></font>	Speaker
437.35	451.42	<font color='rebeccapurple'>To audience. It seems to me to be important to be writing for somebody. For people I-- when I was in my 20s, I had-- one of my great uncle's was the president of Kentucky State. And he</font>	Transcription
451.42	463.33	<font color='rebeccapurple'>was the patriarch of the family. And I used to send him poems and I sent him a batch of poems when I was in college, I think I was about a sophomore in college. And he wrote a very sweet letter back</font>	Transcription
463.36	478.9	<font color='rebeccapurple'>asking me why young poets nowadays don't write poems that people like me can understand. And I thought, that's a really good question. Why shouldn't I be writing for someone? What kind of audience are</font>	Transcription
478.9	489.82	<font color='rebeccapurple'>we looking for, are we imagining if it's not this man? So I completely changed and started working hard on writing accessible poems.</font>	Transcription
489.88	494.17	<font color='peru'><b>Maryemma Graham</b></font>	Speaker
489.88	494.17	<font color='peru'>Well, the first poetry that you were writing, though, was not in this vein.</font>	Transcription
494.17	494.23	<font color='rebeccapurple'><b>Marilyn Nelson</b></font>	Speaker
494.17	494.23	<font color='rebeccapurple'>No.</font>	Transcription
494.36	507.44	<font color='peru'><b>Maryemma Graham</b></font>	Speaker
494.36	507.44	<font color='peru'>So were there influences that you were, you know, that you saw in that poetry where people whose work you respected-- was it the train-- the MFA program that sent you in that</font>	Transcription
507.44	511.85	<font color='peru'>direction? What got you started in that line? And then, clearly, the shift occurs later.</font>	Transcription
510.99	522.9	<font color='rebeccapurple'><b>Marilyn Nelson</b></font>	Speaker
510.99	522.9	<font color='rebeccapurple'>No, I don't have an MFA, I didn't go to a writing program. And I think it was just, I was an English major,</font>	Transcription
514.06	522.91	<font color='peru'><b>Maryemma Graham</b></font>	Speaker
514.06	522.91	<font color='peru'>Yeah. And we do teach English [inaudible].</font>	Transcription
522.91	536.5	<font color='rebeccapurple'><b>Marilyn Nelson</b></font>	Speaker
522.91	536.5	<font color='rebeccapurple'>and I was sitting in classes where we were analyzing things to death. And I was trying to write things that could be analyzed to death. And it took a while to realize that that's not</font>	Transcription
536.5	537.31	<font color='rebeccapurple'>necessary.</font>	Transcription
539.58	550.23	<font color='black'><b>Speaker Unknown</b></font>	Speaker
539.58	550.23	<font color='black'>But the critics like that, because you've got awards, you've got nominations for national book awards. So clearly that tradition of writing was successful for you, if you want to use</font>	Transcription
550.23	551.01	<font color='black'>the term success for that.</font>	Transcription
552.86	566.75	<font color='rebeccapurple'><b>Marilyn Nelson</b></font>	Speaker
552.86	566.75	<font color='rebeccapurple'>Although I hope that all of my published poems-- I mean this incident that I described happened before I was publishing, and I hope that the work I've published is accessible. I've</font>	Transcription
566.75	575.93	<font color='rebeccapurple'>really struggled with that, trying to reach out to an audience to tell my little truths to a big audience.</font>	Transcription
575.0	589.67	<font color='peru'><b>Maryemma Graham</b></font>	Speaker
575.0	589.67	<font color='peru'>A loaded question: what is your sense of where Black poetry is today? I hear what you say about what you want to do in terms of audience. What's your sense of where we are today? Are</font>	Transcription
590.51	600.65	<font color='peru'>we having a bigger impact? Are we-- do we have serious poets among us that we can look forward to another generation or so poetry, or, just how would you sum it up?</font>	Transcription
602.88	613.74	<font color='rebeccapurple'><b>Marilyn Nelson</b></font>	Speaker
602.88	613.74	<font color='rebeccapurple'>I'm not sure if I can sum it up because I don't have my finger on-- you'd have to have your finger on many pulses to be able to answer this question. One of the things that I think has</font>	Transcription
613.74	632.49	<font color='rebeccapurple'>happened is that we, as-- if there was a movement, the Black Arts Movement, for example, it's become fragmented. Because so many, so many young poets now are studying in MFA programs where there are</font>	Transcription
632.49	646.83	<font color='rebeccapurple'>only one or two African American students, maybe one African American poet teaching them. So that we're divided, and a conference like Furious Flower is really important, because it brings people</font>	Transcription
646.83	660.72	<font color='rebeccapurple'>together, they're-- we need to have this kind of communication. I've been very, very much moved by teaching in the Cave Canem program for that reason, because it brings people together. So we have a</font>	Transcription
660.72	677.85	<font color='rebeccapurple'>dialogue, we can discover what we have in common, we can work together in similar directions. I don't think we want to all be marching lockstep, but I think we can grow by exchanging ideas.</font>	Transcription
678.42	690.09	<font color='black'><b>Speaker Unknown</b></font>	Speaker
678.42	690.09	<font color='black'>So the diffusion and dispersal effect, you think, has not necessarily been-- it may have provided good training for people but it may not have done a lot to nurture or, you know, a</font>	Transcription
690.12	691.86	<font color='black'>tradition of Black poetry writing.</font>	Transcription
